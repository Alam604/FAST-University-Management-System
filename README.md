# FAST University Management System (FAST UMS) – Java  
A complete academic management system built using **Java**, structured around **Discrete Mathematics** concepts.

This project was created for FAST University's Discrete Structures course and demonstrates the application of sets, relations, logic, induction, and functions inside a real-world academic management system.
